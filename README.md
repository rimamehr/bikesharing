# Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze NYC Citibike utilization and build visualizations that can help us learn more about the business and draw some conclusions around how to implement this business successfully in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. 

You can visit the Dashboard at this Link - [NYC Bike Utilization](https://public.tableau.com/shared/SZ8SDJHDP?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)

You can also visit some additional graphs we created to slice and dice the data - [Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_16110748737800/NYCCitiBike?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)


## Results/Visualization in our story:

- The first slide shows the number of rides by trip duration broken down by hours and minutes. The peak trip duration is between 4-6 hours. We also a similar comparative graph broken down by gender where we see that Male riders are higher utilizers of the citibike and have higher trip duration than female riders.

- We then look at a heat map to see what most popular time is in regards to the day of the week. This is futher broken down by gender as well. This is a great graphical reprentation showing us that the bike utilization is the higest early morning before or to work and in the evening after or from work. This graph is extremely helpful in dertermining the best time to get bike repairs done. We also see from the graph that over the weekend the utilization is more evenly spread out during the day and not so concentration during early mornings and late evenings. A similar pattern is seen when this data is broken down by gender exept Male riders have higher concentration of utilization compared to females. 

- The third slide breaks down the usage by gender, day of the week and usertype. We see the that the users who have a subscription are using the bikes a lot more than cutomers who have pay as you go.

- We then look at a comparitive map of Manhattan to see the popular locations for the trips to start and end. In comparing these two graphs we can see that Manhattan seems to be the most popular area where the rides generally start and end.

## Summar:

- Based off our analysis and visualization we can be certain that male riders use the citibikes more often than female riders. 

- We also see from the graph that over the weekend the utilization is more evenly spread out during the day and not so concentration during early mornings and late evenings like it is during the work week.

- We also noticed that users who have a subscription are using the bikes a lot more than cutomers who have pay as you go plan.

### Additional graphs:

- We added one additional graph to our story to look at the most popular start stations which can further be mapped to see their exact locations around the city. This will help us make sure enough bikes are available at this location and make sure they are well serviced and ready to go.

- We can also look at other months of the year to see how the utilization changes and if we see a change in trend between gender utilization of the bikes.
